# Flatmate__bill_sharing__app

This application basically uses python to tell how much share of a total bill, each and every person has to pay. For instance , a product of two is calculated here. The Command line interface is being used in order to get the total bill and an python library FPDF is used in order to generate a pdf which will automatically be opened in the default web browser. This is basically object oriented based project, which basically elaborates how to define classes and how to link the entire project together in order to make a working model out of it.
